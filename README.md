This series is referenced by [graviraja](https://github.com/graviraja)'s ML Ops Basics.
Goal of this series is to understand in **"Very Beginners Perspective"** about **MLOps** such as model building, monitoring, configurations, testing, packaging, deployment, cicd, etc. & implement it in a real projects.


## Chapter 1: Project Setup
Refer to the [woozLabs Post](https://woozlabs.web.app/page/post/cc0a09e33dda4d5f929d885dcd178613)

In this chapter our goal is to setup projects in proper way. Following is the simpliest way to setup ML Projects.
However we will improve it to use in real projects through out this whole series.

The project I have implemented is a simple image classification problem. 
following topics are included in this chapter.

- **`Examine and understand data`**
- **`process the data`**
- **`Build an input pipeline`**
- **`Build the model`**
- **`Train the model`**
- **`The inference`**
